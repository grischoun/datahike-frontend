* Quick start
** SERVER, i.e. Clj side
- clj -A:dev:cider-clj -J-Dtrace -J-Dghostwheel.enabled=true
- then in emacs in the project:
  - cider-connect | localhost | <the port it suggests>
  - in the repl: user> (start)
  - in the browser: localhost3000/index.html   (the index.html is important)
  - If restart needed after compilation pblm:
    - (tools-ns/refresh)
    - (start)
** CLIENT, cljs
- cider-jack-in-cljs
  - (This will execute: - npx shadow-cljs server (followed it by '(shadow/repl :main)' if running in a shell) (Use this rather on IntelliJ)
  - Always choose options related to 'shadow'
- You might need to compile the js code here: http://localhost:9630
- The http server is here: http://localhost:8000/
- The nrepl is server in port 9000
